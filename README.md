<h1 align="center">iReady Overload</h1>

As of 2/1, this extension has ~50,000 users meaning 50,000 fewer people have to use iReady. Problem is, that barely makes a dent in i-Ready's 10,000,000+ students (0.5%). If your school uses i-Ready, recommend this extension. They'll thank you.

## Disclaimers

iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly watch the result of a greedy corporation that doesn't try in the SLIGHTEST to make their product enjoyable, or even acceptable. This repository is a collection of hacks and a chrome extension that ensures nobody has to suffer through iReady ever again. The current version has a **lesson & quiz skipper, a diagnostic hack, and a minutes hack**.

<summary><b>Other Info</b></summary>
while (obviously) I try my hardest to prevent you from getting in trouble, there are some things you need to know in order to not get caught. First, I heavily do not recommend using it in school (as they can see all your network traffic) or even on a school issued laptop (only do it if you have to). If want to be very safe, use your own personal computer at your own home.

As shown below iReady's developer team has hilariously banned the text "iReady Overload" from their site so chances are they're reading this right now
