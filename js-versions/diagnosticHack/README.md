# Diagnostic Hack
This hack lets get every diagnostic question right.

# How to Use
Simply open an iReady lesson, use ctrl + shift + i or "inspect element" to open developer tools, click on "console" and paste the code from [start.js](start.js) into the console and hit enter. Then, all questions you enter in the diagnostic will be marked as correct. It is important you still answer questions at a slow pace, however, since the server might make you retake the test or mark it as rushed.

# How to Stop Using
To stop the hack, you can either refresh the page or enter the contents of [end.js](end.js) into the console and hit enter. This will disable the hack and make it so any answer you enter will be marked normally.
